DS Tools is a library of reusable tools for use by Data Scientists. We at Pivotal Data Labs often supplement the functionality provided by [MADlib](http://madlib.net) - our opensource library of in-database machine learning algorithms, by writing `UDFs` in procedural languages such as <B>PL/Python</B>, <B>PL/R</B> and <B>PL/PERL</B>, to solve data science problems for our customers. <B>DSTools</B> is a collection of such libraries packaged for re-usability.
